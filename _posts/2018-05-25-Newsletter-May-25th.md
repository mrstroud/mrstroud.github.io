**Room Changes**

Next week, third grade will be moving to a new hallway. We’ve been hard at work packing our rooms up. 

My new room number will be 13 and new phone number will be 988-6013. 

Most of our move will take place on **Tuesday, May 30th.”** I appreciate your flexibility in the next few days.

**Eggonaut**
  
We will be launching our Eggonaut projects on **Tuesday, May 29th at 9 A.M.** Remember, these projects must be completed by Tuesday and sent to school with your child. Eggs will be provided and loaded by teachers!

**Awards Day**
  
Our awards day is **Wednesday, May 30th at 1:00 P.M. in the gymnasium** Today, I sent home a flyer with your child if they are receiving an award. Please let me know if you have any questions.

**Returning Student Forms**
  
A few weeks ago,  a blue returning student form went home with your child. Please indicate whether your child will be returning to Robey next year, if they will attend another school, or if you aren’t sure. We need them back ASAP. Thank you!

**Transportation**

If you have a change in your child’s transportation from school, please inform me via note or Remind **BEFORE 2:00.** Alternatively, you may contact the office directly and they will let me know.
