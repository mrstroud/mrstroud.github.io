**Hurricane Relief Fundraiser**

Thanks for all of your help with the hurricane fundraiser. We raised over $900! The best part is that I will get a pie in the face!

**Conferences**

Conferences will be in a few weeks. Your child is expected to attend with you as they will help lead.
  
Next week, I’ll send home a reminder of your conference time. If we need to reschedule, I will be in touch with you!

**Number Form Transformation Project**

If this is not finished, please have your child turn in by MONDAY!

**Assignment Notebooks** 

Please ask your child to see these each night, along with their binder. It will help keep you informed of their progress!

Remind messages will still go out each day in supplement to our assignment notebooks.

**Transportation**

If you have a change in your child’s transportation from school, please inform me via note or Remind **BEFORE 2:00.** Alternatively, you may contact the office directly and they will let me know.

**Remind-Announcements and Homework Hotline**

Remind is the service that I use to communicate important information to you. If you want to be in the loop, please sign up ASAP. This is a reminder in addition to your child’s assignment notebook. You may sign up in one of the following ways:
