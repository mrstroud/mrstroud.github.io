**ISTEP Part 2**

ISTEP testing concludes next week. Our schedule is as follows: 
* Tuesday, May 1st

Here are some helpful tips for testing week:
* Continue your ISTEP routine.
* Keep a consistent bedtime each night and get lots of sleep.
* Create time for your child to relax by doing a preferred activity, reading a book, playing a board game, etc.
* Nutrition is important! Lots of protein in the morning will stay with them through the test. Avoid sugary cereals and juices.
* Limit the electronics and video games, especially before bed.

We’re almost there!
