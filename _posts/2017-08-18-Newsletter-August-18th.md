**Amazing Start**

I’m thrilled with how hard your children have worked this week. We added Chromebooks to our routines, explored fluency as readers, learned to think flexibly about numbers, and more.

Thank you so much for allowing me to teach your child this year. I love coming to work each day and am so excited about this year!

**Transitions and Routines**

You might have noticed that your child may be struggling to remember to bring home their binder, may be a bit moody, or may just not be themselves.

This is normal! The responsibility and expectations your child experiences may be a bit more than they can handle right now. They will learn to grow into their new role as a student and transitions like this can take time.

If your child experiences this and is struggling at home, please let me know. I’d love to help out and give you some tips.

**Binders**

Daily Binder-This should go home and come back to school each day. This contains ALL of the work they do each day. On Friday, any work that is in the front left binder pocket stays home.

**Fundraiser**

Our fundraiser begins TODAY! Order deadline is **Tuesday, September 5th**. Delivery of these items will be during conferences on Tuesday, October 10th and Thursday, October 12th.
