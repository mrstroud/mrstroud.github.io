**Conferences**

Conferences will be next week. Your child is expected to attend with you as they will help lead.

Please let me know if you have a question about your child’s time.

**Grades**
Grades should be final by Monday as I finish grading late work.

**Fall Break**
Fall break will begin after next **Friday, October 13th** and will run until **Friday, October 27th**. We will resume school on **Monday, October 30th!**

**Assignment Notebooks** 

Please ask your child to see these each night, along with their binder. It will help keep you informed of their progress!

Remind messages will still go out each day in supplement to our assignment notebooks.

**Transportation**

If you have a change in your child’s transportation from school, please inform me via note or Remind **BEFORE 2:00.** Alternatively, you may contact the office directly and they will let me know.
