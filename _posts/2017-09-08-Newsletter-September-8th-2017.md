**Midterms**

Midterms went home with your child today. Please sign and return on Monday. If you have any questions, please let me know.

**Assignment Notebooks**

Your child received an assignment notebook this week. We’ll use this to help us keep track of assignments, due dates, and more. Please ask your child to see these each night, along with their binder. It will help keep you informed of their progress!

Remind messages will still go out each day in supplement to our assignment notebooks.

**Absences Next Week**

Next week, I will be out on Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, I will be updating Horizons curriculum and on Friday, I will be attending Indiana’s “Flipping the Switch” Computer Science Conference. 

We already started working on computer programming (or coding) by talking about the binary system. Your child also began working on exercises  on Code.org. Every week, we’ll continue to do this during our lunch bunch each Wednesday. 

**Number Sense Transformation Project**

Next week, we will begin our “Number Sense Transformation” project. Students will use their knowledge of place value and will research different numbering systems to transform numbers. Format will be your child’s choice: poster, Google Presentation, video, and more. 

This project will begin on **Monday, September 11th** and will be due on **Friday, September 22nd.** Your child will have time to work on this in class and will have the opportunity to work at home as well.

I will send out more information next week through Remind.

**Transportation**

If you have a change in your child’s transportation from school, please inform me via note or Remind BEFORE 2:00. Alternatively, you may contact the office directly and they will let me know.
