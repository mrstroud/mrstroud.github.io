Her book will be available for the REDUCED price of $15. If you would like a signed copy, please return the form in your child’s binder, along with payment (cash or check please).

**Camp Tecumseh Volunteering**

If you are interested in chaperoning our Camp Tecumseh trip on May 16th and 17th, please fill out the GREEN FORM and send it back with your child. Chaperones will need to pay the $60 fee as well. 

There is a **mandatory** training on **Saturday May 5th** from 9:30-12:30.

If you need more time to decide or to ask off for work, please indicate that on your form.

**State Museum Trip** 
  
On **Friday, December 8th **, we will travel to the Indiana State Museum. We will leave around 9:30 and arrive back to school around 2. 
  
This field trip is **FREE** for students this year. If you are interested in volunteering, please let me know and I will send home a background check form. I’m currently checking on admission fees for parents.

Field trip permission and medical form went home today. Please sign and return as soon as possible.

**Assignment Notebooks** 

Please ask your child to see these each night, along with their binder. It will help keep you informed of their progress!

Remind messages will still go out each day in supplement to our assignment notebooks.

**Transportation**

If you have a change in your child’s transportation from school, please inform me via note or Remind **BEFORE 2:00.** Alternatively, you may contact the office directly and they will let me know.
