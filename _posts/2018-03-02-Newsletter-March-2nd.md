**ISTEP Testing Next Week!**

ISTEP will continue NEXT WEEK. We have worked hard to prepare for the test and will continue to do so.

Our schedule is as follows:
* Tuesday, March 6th

Here are some helpful tips for testing week:
* Continue your ISTEP routine
*  Keep a consistent bedtime each night and get lots of sleep.
* Create time for your child to relax by doing a preferred activity, reading a book, playing a board game, etc.
* Nutrition is important! Lots of protein in the morning will stay with them through the test. Avoid sugary cereals and juices.
* Limit the electronics and video games, especially before bed.

IREAD will begin the week of March 12th. Please keep in mind that we test in the morning. If you have appointments, please make sure they are in the afternoons on testing days!

**PTO Dine Out Day**

On Thursday, March 15th, our PTO is hosting another dine out fundraiser at the Fazoli’s on 10th Street. TWENTY PERCENT of your total goes back to our PTO!

**Camp Tecumseh Updates and Volunteering**

Camp is only a few short months away! Remember- **$60 camp fee** will need to be paid. If you would like to go ahead and pay now, or pay in increments, please do so.  Camp medical forms are due **April 30th**. Please let me know if you need an extra copy.

If you are interested in chaperoning our Camp Tecumseh trip on May 16th and 17th, please fill out the GREEN FORM and send it back with your child. Chaperones will need to pay the $60 fee as well.
