**No School Tuesday-PD Day**

Remember, **Tuesday, November 7th** is our District Professional Development Day. **Students will not report to school.**Teachers will be engaged in learning all day!

**Camp Tecumseh Volunteering**

If you are interested in chaperoning our Camp Tecumseh trip on May 16th and 17th, please fill out the GREEN FORM and send it back with your child next week. Chaperones will need to pay the $60 fee as well. 

There is a **mandatory** training on **Saturday May 5th** from 9:30-12:30.

If you need more time to decide or to ask off for work, please indicate that on your form.

**State Museum Trip** 
  
On **Friday, December 8th **, we will travel to the Indiana State Museum. We will leave around 9:30 and arrive back to school around 2. 
  
This field trip is **FREE** for students this year. If you are interested in volunteering, please let me know and I will send home a background check form. I’m currently checking on admission fees for parents.

Field trip permission and medical form will go home next week.

**DMR Changes**

You’ll notice that our DMR/DLR looks different this week. We are taking time to align our curriculum and current skills to our math review. There is also now an element of choice that wasn’t there before.

Grades will not be taken on DMR this week, but will be taken for DMR. We will continue to transition to our new format over the next few weeks.

**Assignment Notebooks** 

Please ask your child to see these each night, along with their binder. It will help keep you informed of their progress!

Remind messages will still go out each day in supplement to our assignment notebooks.

**Transportation**

If you have a change in your child’s transportation from school, please inform me via note or Remind **BEFORE 2:00.** Alternatively, you may contact the office directly and they will let me know.
