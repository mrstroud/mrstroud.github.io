**IREAD** Testing Next Week!** 
IREAD test will begin next week. We are almost finished with the first round of testing!

Our schedule is as follows:

Here are some helpful tips for testing week:
* Continue the same ISTEP routine for IREAD.
*  Keep a consistent bedtime each night and get lots of sleep.
* Create time for your child to relax by doing a preferred activity, reading a book, playing a board game, etc.
* Nutrition is important! Lots of protein in the morning will stay with them through the test. Avoid sugary cereals and juices.
* Limit the electronics and video games, especially before bed.

We will test in the mornings on Tuesday and Wednesday. If make up testing is needed, we will test on Thursday and Friday.
