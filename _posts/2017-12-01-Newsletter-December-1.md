Our class has the chance to visit the Indiana Repertory Theatre on **Wednesday, December 6th** to see Dance Kaleidoscope’s “A World of Christmas.” Students will depart at 10:45 and get back to school around 1:30 P.M. 

We will eat lunch when we return to school. Please send a sack lunch with your child that day.

If you haven’t returned the permission form or $2, please do so by Monday! Students will need to dress up and we will need $2 for transportation to and from the event.

**State Museum Trip** 
  
On **Friday, December 8th **, we will travel to the Indiana State Museum. We will leave around 9:30 and arrive back to school around 2. 
  
This field trip is **FREE** for students this year. 

Your child will need a sack lunch and needs to wear comfortable shoes. 

**Santa Shop**

Next week, we will visit PTO’s Santa Shop. This is an opportunity for students to shop for gifts for friends and family. A flier went home this week about it.
  
We shop on **Tuesday, December 5th.** PTO is asking that you send no more than $30 so other students can shop.

**Camp Tecumseh Volunteering**

If you are interested in chaperoning our Camp Tecumseh trip on May 16th and 17th, please fill out the GREEN FORM and send it back with your child. Chaperones will need to pay the $60 fee as well. 

There is a **mandatory** training on **Saturday May 5th** from 9:30-12:30.

If you need more time to decide or to ask off for work, please indicate that on your form.

**Assignment Notebooks** 

Please ask your child to see these each night, along with their binder. It will help keep you informed of their progress!

Remind messages will still go out each day in supplement to our assignment notebooks.

If you have a change in your child’s transportation from school, please inform me via note or Remind **BEFORE 2:00.** Alternatively, you may contact the office directly and they will let me know.
