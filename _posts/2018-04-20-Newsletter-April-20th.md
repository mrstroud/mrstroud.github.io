**ISTEP Part 2**

ISTEP testing continues next week. We test at 9:00am each day. Our schedule is as follows: 
* Thursday, April 26th
* Friday, April 27th
* Tuesday, May 1st

Here are some helpful tips for testing week:
* Continue your ISTEP routine.
* Keep a consistent bedtime each night and get lots of sleep.
* Create time for your child to relax by doing a preferred activity, reading a book, playing a board game, etc.
* Nutrition is important! Lots of protein in the morning will stay with them through the test. Avoid sugary cereals and juices.
* Limit the electronics and video games, especially before bed.
