**Hurricane Relief Fundraiser**
Beginning next week, we will raise money for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Students may bring change or dollar bills to deposit in their favorite teacher’s bucket. The top **SEVEN** teachers will get a pie in the face!

**National Run at School Day**
We will participate in "National Run at School Day" next Friday, September 22nd. This is a time to promote physical fitness and is an awesome opportunity to see all of us be active! Since we are out in the morning, your child should bring a change of shoes and socks in case their feet get wet from the dew. 

Ms. Klarich needs volunteers! If you have not already filled out the form, please let her know if you can help: Diana.Klarich@wayne.k12.in.  

**New Novel Begins Next Week: Island: Shipwreck**

We will begin a new novel next week called **Island: Shipwreck** by Gordon Korman. This novel does a great job of showing multiple character perspectives and development. 

There are a few instances of language and one section where a character makes reference to a girl in a swimsuit. 
  
Please let me know if you have questions!

**Number Form Transformation Project**

Last week, we began our “Number Sense Transformation” project. Students will use their knowledge of place value and will research different numbering systems to transform numbers. Format will be your child’s choice: poster, Google Presentation, video, and more. We will intentionally teach how to create a presentation and a poster next week. If your child needs a poster, please let me know. 

My apologies about the incorrect due date. The correct date is **Friday, September 22nd.** Your child will have time to work on this in class and will have the opportunity to work at home as well. This is not homework. If you have questions, please let me know. us.

**Assignment Notebooks** 

We spent our first full week of using our assignment notebooks.  We’ll use this to help us keep track of assignments, due dates, and more. Please ask your child to see these each night, along with their binder. It will help keep you informed of their progress!

Remind messages will still go out each day in supplement to our assignment notebooks.

**Transportation**

If you have a change in your child’s transportation from school, please inform me via note or Remind **BEFORE 2:00.** Alternatively, you may contact the office directly and they will let me know.
